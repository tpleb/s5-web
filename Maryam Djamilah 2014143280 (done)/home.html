<font style="font-size:20px;color:purple;font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
	Once upon a time, there was no Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Youtube.
	<br>Our lives didn't revolve around a steam of status updates, tweets, videos and filtered photos.
	<br>That was just 10 years ago.
	<br>For me, social media isn't about technology, it's about people.
	<br>Connection, emotion, expression become the souls and personalities of online communities.
	<br>And that's why I take it seriously. Our generation is the first generation of social media.
	<br>Soon..Our children, our grandchildren'll live in totally different environment than us today.
	<br>We're the makers of our future and it'll be up to us whether we end up crafting a generation of idiots
	<br>by being ignorance on what's happening in the social media world today, or if we use technology and
	<br>social media to design and create our most intimate selves in the new world. It's going to be your call. - KP
	<br>Welcome social media world! Welcome 2017!
